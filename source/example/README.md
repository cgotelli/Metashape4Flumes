# Example

This folder RAW, and its two subfolders are the only ones necessary to start the workflow of the different surveys. 

In the subfolder 'photos' we must put the images of the different surveys of the experiment, divided into different folders (it does not matter the name of these subfolders). Later, the name of each folder will become the filename for their correspondent project file. 

In the subfolder 'config_common' we need at least the file 'baseConfig.yml'. This file contains the common settings for the different projects, and it will be used by the matlab script 'build.m' for writing the configuration file to be used by each project.
